# Horiba_Aqualog_data_processing
Matlab script using PLS toolbox (Eigenvector) to cut orient, normalize and export absorbance spectra and EEMs.
Use in conjunction with Kane Lab protocol (docx).
Data export script for EEMs collected at ex 240 - 800 nm by 3 nm incements. Em 3.28 nm increments from 212 - 620 nm.
Inputs are exported CSV files. 

Employs flucut for inner filter corrections, raman and raleigh cutting.

Converts absorbance to absroption coefficients. 
Converts raw emmissions to Raman Normalized and Quinene Sulfate Equivalent emmissions using 10 ppm QSW in 0.0105 M HCLO4
